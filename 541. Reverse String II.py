# Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
#
# If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
# Output: "bacdfeg"
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
# Output: "bacd"
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of only lowercase English letters.
# 1 <= k <= 104
